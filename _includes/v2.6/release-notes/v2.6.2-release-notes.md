Calico v2.6.2 adds fixes and enhancements for Calico/OpenStack deployments.  For Kubernetes and other integrations there is no change from v2.6.1.

- The dnsmasq packages that we provide have been upgraded so as to address various [security issues](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/issues/1169).

- networking-calico master has been released, as 1.4.3, so as to provide support for OpenStack Ocata and later.

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert"><b>Important</b>: If you are using the Kubernetes datastore and upgrading from Calico v2.4.x or earlier to Calico v2.5.x or later, you must <a href="https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/blob/master/upgrade/v2.5/README.md">migrate your Calico configuration data</a> before upgrading. Otherwise, your cluster may lose connectivity after the upgrade.</div>
