Calico v2.6.3 addresses several outstanding common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE).

- A new node controller for Kubernetes deployments clears data associated with deleted nodes from the Calico datastore, preventing conflicts that can lead to crash loops.

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert"><b>Important</b>: If you are using the Kubernetes datastore and upgrading from Calico v2.4.x or earlier to Calico v2.5.x or later, you must <a href="https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/blob/master/upgrade/v2.5/README.md">migrate your Calico configuration data</a> before upgrading. Otherwise, your cluster may lose connectivity after the upgrade.</div>
