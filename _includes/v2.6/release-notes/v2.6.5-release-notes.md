- Resolves an issue which led to very brief loss of connectivity
    after upgrading to v3.0.0 from v2.6.4 when using an etcd datastore.
    [https://github.com/projectcalico/felix/pull/1676]

- Certain configuration changes no longer cause Felix to restart, allowing
    upgrades to Calico v3.0.0. [felix #1631](https://github.com/projectcalico/felix/pull/1631) (@fasaxc)

- Calico now assigns the host side of veth pairs a MAC address of `ee:ee:ee:ee:ee:ee`.
    If this fails, it uses a kernel-generated MAC address as before. For more information,
    refer to the [Troubleshooting FAQ](https://docs.projectcalico.org/v2.6/usage/troubleshooting/). [cni-plugin #436](https://github.com/projectcalico/cni-plugin/pull/436) (@tmjd)

- `calicoctl` now includes a new environment variable called `CALICO_LIBNETWORK_VETH_MTU`
    that allows you to configure the MTU of veth endpoints when using the Docker orchestrator.
